### Description
In this project I have created a website to showcase the work I have completed during my time in the Web Development Boot Camp at UCLA Extension. This website currently consists of a landing page, and a profile. The profile has an about me, projects, and a contact page. The landing page utilizes main.scss to generate the the css required for the animations. The entire site has a consistent navigation bar that functions properly as well as a sticky footer that is translucent. On the navigation bar there are links to my LinkedIn and my GitHub profile. The pages are responsive and will scale without distorting images. The profile page consists of the recent works I wish to highlight as well as links to specific repositories. The about me page gives a brief summary of who I am and why I do what I do as well as a list of skills. The contact page has contact information as well as a link to my view my resume. In the future I will create a contact form that will alow users to easily send me an email directly through the app.
